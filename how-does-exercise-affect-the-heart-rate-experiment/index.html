<p>The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit of time). Exercise, exercise times, pulse location, drink consumption. It is obvious that the breathing rate is directly proportional to heart rate and both should amalgamate during exercise to prevent illness (haldane, 2013).

<p>When you are exercising, your muscles need extra oxygen—some three times as much as resting muscles. These include decreased resting heart rate, improved ability to draw in deeper breaths, reduced resting blood pressure, increased calories burned to aid weight loss and reduced risk of heart disease.

<p>A young, healthy athlete may have a heart rate of 30 to 40 bpm. During exercise, the heart must beat faster to eliminate excess carbon dioxide and increase the supply of oxygen in the body. Sweating draws water from the blood and, over time, leaves less blood flowing through your heart and to your muscles, reducing oxygen supply to the muscles.
