Zumba Dance Workout for Weight Loss From healze.com
If you find yourself wanting to skip a workout or go in vain, a dance session will help you burn calories, work off stress, and get your heart rate up. The strength training and the cardio vascular activity make pole dancing one of the most effective dance forms that can be used to lose weight. To reap the maximum benefits out of this dance form, try practicing hip hop dance twice or thrice every week, coupled with proper diet and rest. Ballroom dances such as tango may burn less calories than intense aerobic activities, but they’re also gentler on your body.
