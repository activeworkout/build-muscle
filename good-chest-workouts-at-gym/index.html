CHEST DAY EXERCISE From weighteasyloss.com
Lift your body back up to the starting position by pushing up with your arms. Straighten your elbows and puff your chest out to feel a stretch. Keep your elbows straight, your head aligned with your knees, and your wrists right under your forearms. These are isolation exercises, good for targeting the chest but won’t force you to go too heavy unless, with good form, you’re really looking to pack on the size with heavy weights.
