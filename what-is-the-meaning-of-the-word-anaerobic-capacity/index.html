6 response of the cardiovascular system to exercise From slideshare.net
Of, relating to, or being activity in which the body incurs an oxygen debt. Work capacity can be described as the maximal contribution of anaerobic and aerobic energy systems to administer force over a given distance in a specified time. Anaerobic capacity is the one that is put into practice when high intensity exercises are executed, for which it is necessary to apply considerable force. Increase muscle strength and power.
