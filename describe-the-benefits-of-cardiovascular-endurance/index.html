Cardiovascular or cardiopulmonary endurance is your physical ability to maintain aerobic exercise for prolonged periods of time. Increasing cardiovascular fitness means boosting the capability of the heart and the cardiovascular system to supply oxygen and energy. The threshold is the minimal intensity you have to reach to obtain cardiovascular fitness benefits. Cardiovascular endurance enables you to get the most out of your exercise, allowing you to maintain a healthy weight.
