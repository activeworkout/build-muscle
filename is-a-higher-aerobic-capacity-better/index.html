<p>Aerobic capacity refers to how easily your body is able to transport oxygen to your muscle cells and how easily the oxygen can be taken up by these muscle cells. Start to increase the duration of your workout to increase and improve aerobic capacity. An increase in aerobic fitness can improve recovery time between the high intensity bursts within a soccer match, thus having a positive effect on repeated sprint ability [2]. Even better news is that if you sustain an honest effort over time, each year nearly compounds itself, so by the end of year 3 the results are better than linear growth.
