PPT Metabolic effects of Insulin and Glucagon Metabolism in the Well From slideserve.com
In people with diabetes and in most people with type 2 diabetes, insulin levels in the blood fall during exercise, and the rise in glucagon released from the pancreas. If insulin is injected, however, the body can’t lower the circulating levels when starting exercise. If your insulin activity is at its peak during. With intensive insulin therapy, since each insulin dose lasts only a short period, it is fairly easy to make alterations in the dose for exercise.

<p>Regulating insulin levels during exercise. In people who have a pancreas that functions normally, insulin levels typically decrease during exercise, and levels of a hormone called glucagon (released from the alpha cells of the pancreas) rise to stimulate glucose release (1). In people with diabetes and in most people with type 2 diabetes, insulin levels in the blood fall during exercise, and the rise in glucagon released from the pancreas. Prolonged exercise can also predispose to decreased glucose counter regulation. Intense Exercise Has Unique Effects on Both Insulin Release and Its.</p>
