<p>All organisms respire in order to release energy to fuel their living processes. Metabolism refers to a set of chemical reactions carried out for maintaining the living state of the cells in an organism. This process is known as cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is a metabolic process consisting of a series of steps to convert chemical energy (sugar) into a usable form of energy (atp) in the cell.
