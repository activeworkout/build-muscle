What Happens to your blood pressure during exercise? From healthworldbt.com
Ideal resting blood pressure levels are below 120 systolic, and below 80 diastolic, or less. The rise is blood pressure causes a reflex decrease in heart rate via arterial baroreceptors and bradycardia is produced. Stay well hydrated and slowly increase your exercise level. Blood pressure is simply the.

On average diastolic blood pressure increases to a greater extent during bicycle ergometry than during treadmill, while no differences in exertional systolic blood pressure have been observed between the 2 tests.
