The test requires a blood sample that is usually taken from a vein in the arm. The igm antibody recognizes a large variety of pathogenic antigens and plays an important role in body immunity. The anti cadiolipin igg antibody test should be carried out only if a clinical symptom is followed by the presence of the serum anticardiolipin antibody. Isolated iga acl are not very common, therefore their testing could.

<p>In 1999, an international consensus conference found that one criterion for the serologic diagnosis of “definite antiphospholipid syndrome” is the presence of anticardiolipin antibody of igg and/or igm isotype, at medium or high titer, on two or more occasions, at least six weeks apart. There are actually three types of cardiolipin. All antibodies must be demonstrated on 2 or more occasions separated by at least 12 weeks.

Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them emerging, temporarily due to an infection or drug, or asymptomatically as a person ages. In 1999, an international consensus conference found that one criterion for the serologic diagnosis of “definite antiphospholipid syndrome” is the presence of anticardiolipin antibody of igg and/or igm isotype, at medium or high titer, on two or more occasions, at least six weeks apart.
