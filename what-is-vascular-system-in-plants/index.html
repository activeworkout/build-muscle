These are usual­ly primary in nature. The plant vascular system is made up of two networks of tubes, known as the xylem and phloem, which are the water and food conducting systems. There are generally 2 types of leaves for vascular plants viz, microphylls and megaphylls. Moreover, they bring minerals up from the roots and the byproducts of photosynthesis down to supply them throughout the parts of the plant.

<p>Vascular plants possess a xylem, which transports food and water to the phloem. The vascular tissue system consists of the complex tissues, xylem and phloem, which constitute discrete conducting strands called vascular bundles. It conducts water, nutrients, sugars, proteins and rna through the plant through lignified tissues. Plant cells form veins that are extremely efficient at sending supplies up to the incredible heights that plants can. Introduction to Vascular Plant Structure Digital Atlas of Ancient Life.</p>

<p>Vascular plants are those plants, which have specialised vascular tissues for the transport of water, minerals and food. Xylem tissue transports water and dissolved minerals to the leaves, and phloem tissue conducts food from the leaves to all parts of the plant. Xylem helps in the transport of water from soil to different parts of the plant and phloem helps in the transfer of food prepared in leaves by the. The two primary vascular tissues are xylem, which transports water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the leaves, and phloem, which conducts food from the leaves to all parts of the plant.

<p>They possess true roots, stem and leaves. So the vascular system consists of xylem and phloem which are bundled together forming a vascular bundle. These are not present in nonvascular plants, which is the major difference between the two. The xylem transports water up from the roots and circulates it to all the other sections of the plant’s body. The plant vascular system functions as the conduit for longdistance.</p>

Vascular plants possess a chemical known as lignin, which is a complex polymer of phenolic compounds.lignin is incorporated into an additional cell wall layer, known as the secondary (2 °) wall (figure 4.3), which is found in certain, specialized cells of vascular plants.secondary walls are secreted to the outside of the plasma membrane (between the plasma membrane and the.
