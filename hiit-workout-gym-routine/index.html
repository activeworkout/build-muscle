BURN 150 CALORIES IN 20 MINUTES WITH HIIT Lindsey Walton in 2020 From pinterest.com
You’ll rotate through exercises that target your legs, glutes, core, and upper body that, combined, will help you feel fitter, fast. Including weights in a hiit workout is one of the best ways to increase the challenge and maximise the effectiveness of the exercises. Of course, after doing 10 sets of 10 reps, you’ll no longer be able to complete 10 full reps with your 10rm weight—probably more like five to seven reps. This allows a quick workout to pack a big punch.
