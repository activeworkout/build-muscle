<p>Cardiac enzyme studies measure the levels of enzymes and proteins that are linked with injury of the heart muscle. Most of the early markers identified were enzymes, and as a result, the term cardiac enzymes is. Although they are often discussed in the context of myocardial infarction, other conditions can lead to an elevation in cardiac marker level. When a person suffers from a heart attack, cardiac enzymes are often tested in an emergency setting to confirm the suspicion. Serum Cardiac Enzymes in Stroke Semantic Scholar.</p>
