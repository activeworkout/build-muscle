Circuit Training Combining Cardiovacular Work with Weight Training From completefitnessdesign.com
This circuit is designed to improve cardiovascular and muscular endurance by exercising hard at eight stations with a slow one hundred meter (100m) jog used as recovery between stations. Circuit training is designed to develop cardio vascular respiratory endurance as well as flexibility, strength and muscular endurance in essential muscle groups. This type of workout works well for building muscle endurance because programs designed to improve muscle endurance often call for. When you exercise at a regular intensity, your heart gains in strength and volume.
