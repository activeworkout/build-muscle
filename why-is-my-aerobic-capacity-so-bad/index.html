Everyone’s aerobic threshold is different. Heart rate between 140 and 160 beats per minute. Run below aerobic threshold (often with short, harder strides or faster finishes) the two days in bold are the days to play with truly hard efforts. There are two golden principles you need to keep in mind to increase aerobic capacity.

<p>While cardio training is most often associated with fat loss, it is also the best way to improve aerobic capacity, which is the ability to use oxygen to fuel exercise activity. Aerobic training increases stroke volume and your heart’s ability to deliver blood and oxygen and increases the number of mitochondria inside muscle cells, so you have more “factories” to produce the energy you need to fuel exercise. The aerobic heart rate zone is zone. The difference between the two is that aerobic capacity depends on oxygen intake for the exercises to be performed.
