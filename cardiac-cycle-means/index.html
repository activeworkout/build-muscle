<p>The development of a cardiac cycle is illustrated with the heart rate, which is a natural indication by the number of beatings/minute. Heart tissue is myogenic which means it would initiate its own contraction allowing the heart to contract without needing to be connected to the body. Each cardiac cycle begins with the generation of an electrical stimulus in the sinus node and the consequent contraction of the atria and ends with the relaxation of the ventricles.
