Aerobic metabolic pathways are also referred to as oxidative because of their dependence on o 2 to generate atp. While anaerobic metabolism is not as efficient as aerobic metabolism, incorporating both aerobic and anaerobic types of exercises into your overall workout routine is the most effective way to exercise and burn fuel as energy 3. Sprinting is the best way to boost metabolism and enhance endurance. The at may be defined as the highest.
