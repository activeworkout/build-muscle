<p>Zone 2 hr training is hard… but the payback is. The intensity should still be light, and you should feel like you can sustain the exercise for a longer period of time. The standard running target heart rate zones are defined as follows: Zone 3 is where we spend most of our time at arsenal, and it’s especially effective at improving blood circulation.</p>

<p>The answer is probably somewhere around 97 to 99 percent. As you can see, zone 2 training does help to improve a myriad of aerobic factors, but you need to spend ample amounts of time working in this zone to reap the benefits. The term “threshold” is generally synonymous with other common exercise physiology terms like lactate threshold (lt), anaerobic threshold (at), and maximal lactate steady state (mlss) [1]. Running in zone 3 is especially effective for improving the efficiency of blood circulation in the heart and skeletal muscles. Connect Care Calgary Zone Physicians Wave 2 Alberta Health Services.</p>
