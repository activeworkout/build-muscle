<p>A muscle is a group of muscle tissues which contract together to produce a force. Muscle energy technique (met) is a technique that was developed in 1948 by fred mitchell, sr, d.o. The idea of power is to exert maximum muscle contraction instantly in an explosive burst of movement. Muscle power is defined as the product of muscle strength and muscle contractile velocity (work per unit time), and since daily living involves dynamic muscle action, loss of muscle power could have a greater impact on functional muscle limitation than muscle weakness per se [54].
