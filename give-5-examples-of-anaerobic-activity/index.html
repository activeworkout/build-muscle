But overdoing it can create painful injuries and muscle strains. Cl.ramosam is an anaerobic gram positive, non motile, spore forming bacteria. It is ideal for maintaining the lungs and increasing cardiac resistance. Anaerobic respiration is the respiratory process by which different microorganisms obtain energy and metabolize organic compounds while in the absence of molecular oxygen.
