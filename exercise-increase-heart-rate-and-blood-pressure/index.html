<p>You can do this by taking your pulse for 10 seconds and multiplying by 6. Ideally, a moderate increase in heart rate for about thirty minutes each day is necessary to achieve these benefits. As you exercise more strenuously, the sympathetic system “kicks in” to accelerate your heart rate even more. This happens because the heart needs to supply blood to the skin for cooling you down and it also needs to supply the blood to the working muscles. Exercise phys updated.</p>

Regularly exercising to raise your heart rate optimizes your blood circulation and prevents inflammation, reduces the risk of diabetes, lowers blood pressure, and strengthens the muscles. The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output ( cardiac output = quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit of time) and blood pressure. 11+ Heart Rate Chart Templates Sample Templates.</p>
