Say, for example, that a fit person&#39;s heart beats 55 times per minute and an unfit person&#39;s heart beats 85 times per minute, a difference of 30 beats per minute. For example, sprinting on a treadmill as fast as you can for around 2 minutes. Vo2max = 15.3 x hrmax/hrrest. The maximum rate is based on your age, as subtracted from 220.
