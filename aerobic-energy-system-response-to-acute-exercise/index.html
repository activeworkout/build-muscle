<p>In response to acute exercise, blood flow is markedly. It is known that fats contain energy, these are foods such as chocolate. These physiological pathways are called energy systems, and the most important of these for endurance athletes is the aerobic energy system.let’s take a closer look at how your body utilizes the aerobic system to power you on your bike, and how you can train this system to be more. The creatine phosphate system can provide energy for high intensity activities lasting up to 10 seconds.</p>

<p>The breathing rate and volume of each breath increases to bring more oxygen into. In the 5000m race the runner must use all 3 energy systems , which are atp, aerobic and lactic acid systems to succeed as the race has different areas needed for their use. The blood supply needs to increase due to the fact that it needs to go to the parts in your body which you are exercising the most e.

<p>The ultimate goal of the cardiovascular response to acute aerobic exercise is to maximize cardiac output and match the metabolic demands of the musculoskeletal system.

<p>Energy production must increase to meet demand. The breathing rate and volume of each breath increases to bring more oxygen into. The exact nature of the mechanisms responsible for this heterogeneity in response to regular aerobic exercise is not well known. As a result of exercise, atp stores decrease in the muscle, and stores of adp, the by product of atp increase when exercise intensity increases, there is an increase in the rate of metabolism required to produce atp in the muscles heat is a by product of the process of converting chemical energy (fuel) into mechanical energy (movement).

<p>The creatine phosphate system can provide energy for high intensity activities lasting up to 10 seconds. If you are taking a run, the blood supply will increase because your legs will require more. Energy production must increase to meet demand. In response to acute exercise, blood flow is markedly.

<p>Virtually all tissues in the human body rely on aerobic metabolism for energy production and are therefore critically dependent on continuous supply of oxygen. The ultimate goal of the cardiovascular response to acute aerobic exercise is to maximize cardiac output and match the metabolic demands of the musculoskeletal system. Oxygen is provided by blood flow, and, in essence, changes in organ perfusion are also closely associated with alterations in tissue metabolism. During acute exercise the energy system responds in many different ways. Studying Acute Responses To A Single Bout Of Exercise ExerciseWalls.</p>
