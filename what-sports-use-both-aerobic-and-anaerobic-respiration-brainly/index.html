State two differences between aerobic and anaerobic respiration From brainly.in
Most of the living organisms such as humans animals plants show aerobic mode of respiration. When breakdown of glucose occur with the use of oxygen it is called aerobic respiration. This usually includes any exercise that lasts longer than two minutes. What is produced by both aerobic and anaerobic respiration?.

Anaerobic respiration is seen in organism such as yeast and certain bacteria. Which process yields the most atp? What stage of cellular respiration yields the most atp brainly?</p>

They are called as anaerobes. Aerobic means ‘with air’ and refers to the body that produces energy using oxygen. More detailed differences between the two are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="activities-require-a-combination-of-anaerobic-and-aerobic-exercises">Activities Require A Combination Of Anaerobic And Aerobic Exercises.</h3><p>One occurs in the presence of oxygen ( aerobic ), and one occurs in the absence of oxygen ( anaerobic ). The primary difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is the presence or absence of oxygen during the processes. There are two types of cellular respiration (see cellular respiration concept): Most of the living organisms such as humans animals plants show aerobic mode of respiration.</p>
