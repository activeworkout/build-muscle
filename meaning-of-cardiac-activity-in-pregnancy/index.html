The evaluation of cardiac disease in pregnancy may be complicated by the normal anatomical and functional changes of the cardiovascular system. Cardiac hypertrophy occurs during pregnancy as a consequence of both volume overload and hormonal changes. At 14 weeks, in the level 1 ultrasound no cardiac activity seen. Despite the fact that there are shared transcriptional responses in both forms of cardiac adaptation, pregnancy.

The sections of this tube will go on to form all the structures of the future heart. By the time the embryo measures 2 mm, the fetal heart rate activity should be seen and normal embryos start at under 85 beats per minute heart rate.
