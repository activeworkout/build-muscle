How can the heart increase cardiac output? Socratic From socratic.org
Your heart begins to beat quicker to deliver oxygenated blood to them. This is because during a physical activity, our body needs almost four times our normal heart or cardiac output. When temperatures (and the humidity) soar, the heart pumps a little more blood, so your pulse rate may increase, but usually no more than five to 10 beats a minute. Being physically active is one of the best ways to keep your heart and lungs healthy.
