Reduce inflammation throughout the body. Each exercise will last for 2 minutes and we will do each test twice to make sure that the first result’s weren’t random. This means the heart beats fewer times per minute than it would in a nonathlete. The heart is like the generator of the body.

<p>With all the attention paid to the effect that aerobic exercise has on heart rate, you might think the only requirement for an effective workout is to increase your heart rate. This is fairly obvious for most students in my age group, but the next question asks them to determine the recovery time and compare how recovery times differ for individuals. Normally, the heart rate will increase. Regular exercise causes a reduction in rhr.</p>
