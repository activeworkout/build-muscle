INCREASE YOUR INSULIN SENSITIVITY TO GET RID OF LOVE HANDLES From mavasports.com
Insulin sensitivity is your body’s ability to pull glucose out of the blood stream and put it into your cells so that glucose can be used for energy or fuel for the cell. Unless you are an endurance athlete, however, excess carbs can be toxic to the body, as they all convert to glucose—and diseases like cancer love excess glucose. Exercise reduces insulin sensitivity in the rest of the body. Exercise works like an invisible insulin shot, as the muscle cells are among the only cells in the body that can uptake glucose without insulin.
