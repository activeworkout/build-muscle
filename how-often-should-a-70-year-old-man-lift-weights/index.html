From venturebeat.com
We do not recommend weight training more than 5 times a week as this can overexert your body and make an injury more likely. In the days of men’s fitness and abercrombie and fitch ads, it occurs that once you pass 25 years of age you should resort to bingo and pureed foods. Well, i am a 55 year old woman, with just medium motivation, and i lift for 22 minutes 6 days a week. What can older men (and women) do about this?
