<p>Vo2max reflects the maximum rate that the respiratory, cardiovascular, and muscular systems can take in, transport, and use oxygen during exercise. In other words, it is the lowest speed at which maximum oxygen uptake (v0 2 max) occurrs (2, 3). Fitness tests are more accurate since they track your oxygen intake during a specific exercise in a controlled environment. The fitness calculator estimates your fitness age measured as maximum oxygen uptake (vo2max). VO2 Max &amp; Aerobic Fitness Explained.</p>
