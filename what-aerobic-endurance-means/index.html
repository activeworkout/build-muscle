<p>Aerobic endurance is a crucial component of training programmes, especially for elite sportspeople or simply those looking for a health boost. The aerobic threshold is the uppermost limit of exercise when the production of energy starts to become dominated by anaerobic glycolysis (sugars) rather than the oxidation (aerobic in nature) of fats. The muscles have to rely on the stored reserves of fuel. It’s common that training which develops the aerobic system is equated with training that increases the body’s endurance.
