During aerobic exercise, you breathe faster and deeper than when your heart rate is at rest. In fact, anaerobic means absence of oxygen. this can be contrasted with aerobic exercise that consumes oxygen at a sustainable pace such that an activity can be continued for a long duration of time. Despite the high quality of most of the investigations, the terms aerobic/anaerobic continue to be used. The idea is that a lot of energy.
