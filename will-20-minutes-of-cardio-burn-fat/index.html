Remember everything i have said is for fat burning only, i would suggest a different routine etc for building up resistance, fitness etc. Fasted cardio is not superior to regular cardio for fat loss. Strength training won&#39;t burn much fat, but by increasing muscle tissue it speeds up your metabolism so you constantly expend more calories. First, the body always uses some combination of fat and carbohydrate during exercise.
