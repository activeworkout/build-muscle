Essentially, your cardiorespiratory fitness level is a measure of the strength of your aerobic energy system. While in the high intensity more fat is burned after the training. The results of a series of experiments carried out under heavy physical loads during the training of 96 elite cyclists, rowers and swimmers were based on the following: To maintain cardiorespiratory endurance, training must be conducted at least three times per week, and training.
