Cardiorespiratory endurance is the ability of the cardiorespiratory system to supply nutrients and oxygen to the body during sustained physical activity. It is 10 to 20 beats per minute lower. At rest, a healthy cardiorespiratory system has little difficulty keeping pace with the body&#39;s need for oxygen, fuel, and waste removal. What happens to the resting heart rate as a result of regular endurance exercise?
