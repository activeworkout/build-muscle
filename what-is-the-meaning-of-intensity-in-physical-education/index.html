<p>It has been found that intensity has an effect on what fuel the body uses and what kind of adaptations the body makes after exercise. Somewhere in between those two extremes is the level of intensity at which you perform your best. This can be measured directly using respiratory gas analysis to quantify oxygen uptake during exercise or can be estimated using standard regression models to estimate energy expenditure per a given workrate of exercise. Because the exact intensity of an activity varies among individuals, terms such as moderate or vigorous are used as a guide. Definition of physical fitness measure your strength, endurance.</p>
