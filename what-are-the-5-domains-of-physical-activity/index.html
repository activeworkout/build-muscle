In addition to the dimensions of physical activity, the domains in which physical activity occurs are central to understanding the assessment of physical activity. The relationship between physical activity and positive mental health seems to vary between different domains of physical activity. There is growing evidence on positive effects of pa on mental health [1,2,3,4] and on a positive association between pa and mental health [1,2,3, 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14].however, the focus of research on this relationship has more. What are the 4 domains of physical activity?
