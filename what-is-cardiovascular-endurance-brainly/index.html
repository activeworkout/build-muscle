Cardiovascular endurance is the ability to exercise without becoming overly tired because your heart, lungs and blood vessels are healthy. Exercisers can improve cardiorespiratory endurance by participating in a program of regular aerobic exercise. You need to think out of the box/do a paradigm shift from the normal way of exercising. Cardiovascular endurance consists of maintaining an increased heart rate and breathing rate for a longer period of time.
