What is Cardio exercise and why should I do it… Chilli Pilates From chillipilates.co.uk
Cardiovascular exercise is any vigorous activity that increases heart rate and respiration and raises oxygen and blood flow throughout the body while using large muscle groups of the body repetitively and rhythmically. The dictionary definition for cv training is: Active exercise motion imparted to a part by voluntary contraction and relaxation of its controlling muscles. Cardiorespiratory fitness is important to measure because it provides a diagnostic tool for certain health issues and is a good measure of the amount of work an individual&#39;s body can perform.
