Anticardiolipin antibodies and recurrent coronary events a prospective From researchgate.net
Cardiolipin ab igg, igm, iga: High levels of the igm isotype are associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, a condition in which an individual’s immune system attacks their red blood cells. Thank you for the response. The anti cardiolipin igm antibody test enables you to diagnose inappropriate blood clot, analyze the cause for regular miscarriages, and analyze any autoimmune diseases.

Anticardiolipin (acl) antibodies measured above 20 cu are considered positive and are associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (aps) as described by international consensus and harris et al [1, 2]. Beta2 glycoprotein 1 is the protein in the body to which anticardiolipin antibodies bind, and it is also possible to measure antibodies to beta2.

<p>Cardiolipin is a normal component on cells and platelets and is important in the clotting process. I had lots of clotting in my placenta and umbilical cord as well as a placental abruption so this testing was performed. In 1999, an international consensus conference found that one criterion for the serologic diagnosis of “definite antiphospholipid syndrome” is the presence of anticardiolipin antibody of igg and/or igm isotype, at medium or high titer, on two or more occasions, at least six weeks apart. The test requires a blood sample that is usually taken from a vein in the arm. elevated immunoglobulin m,qn,serum elevated anticardiolip.</p>
