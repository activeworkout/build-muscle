<p>Cellular respiration refers to the metabolic reactions at the cellular level that result in the breakdown of molecules from nutrients and the release of energy that is used to fuel cellular processes. A catabolic process (see catabolism) occurring in cells where complex organic molecules are broken down to release energy for other cellular processes. Wikipedia tells us that cellular respiration is the set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the. Cell respiration usually occurs in the presence of oxygen (see aerobic respiration) but some organisms can respire without oxygen (see anaerobic respiration ). Cellular Respiration.</p>
