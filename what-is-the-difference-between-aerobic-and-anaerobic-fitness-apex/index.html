Aerobic means ‘with oxygen’ and comes from the greek words for air (aero) and life (bios). The difference between aerobic and anaerobic activity is easy to feel during the action as the exercise intensity increases. 1.aerobic uses oxygen while anaerobic does not rely on oxygen. This is why these types of exercises are called activities instead of exercises.

<p>Aerobic exercise is dependent on oxygen intake as an energy source. Therefore, the body produces and then uses lactate as its fuel source, fed by glycogen. Aerobic exercise is any sort of endurance training, like running long distances. As we can see, the main differences between aerobic and anaerobic exercises are duration, intensity, and above all, energy spent.</p>

<p>Aerobic workouts generally include anything at a low intensity or moderate intensity. You’re maximizing the amount of oxygen in. Aerobics takes more endurance than anaerobics because it goes on for much longer while anaerobics are done in quick bursts of intense energy.

When you exercise aerobically, your breathing and heart rate increase, and your muscle cells demand a steady oxygen flow. Whereas, for anaerobic exercise, the muscles depend on other alternate sources of energy. With anaerobic exercise, it's usually only about 10 seconds or less at a time.</p>
