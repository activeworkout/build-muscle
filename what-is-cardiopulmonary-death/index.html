Sudden cardiac death (scd) is an unexpected death that occurs as a result of malfunctioning in the heart’s electrical system. Scd most likely results from a cascade of “upstream” events that create an electrically unstable heart that most often is manifested by a ventricular. A defibrillator is a device. Even sudden witnessed death may be produced by a sudden mechanical or vascular catastrophe (pulmonary embolus, cardiac, or vascular rupture) rather than a malignant cardiac rhythm abnormality.
