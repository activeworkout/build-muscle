On a 1 to10 scale for perceived exertion, high intensity anaerobic exercise is anything over a seven. A study in the journal of applied physiology verified those sentiments, and mentioned that aerobics are optimal for reducing fat mass and body mass over resistance training. This helps burn fat and build strong, lean muscle mass. What Is the Difference Between Aerobic &amp; Anaerobic Exercise.</p>
