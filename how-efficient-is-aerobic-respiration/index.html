It made the process more energetically efficient, thus promoting the development of higher animals. While aerobic respiration can produce up. 12 Difference Between Aerobic Respiration And Anaerobic Respiration.</p>
<h3 id="respirare--to-breath-was-first-used-to-describe-the-breathing-ie">Respirare = To Breath) Was First Used To Describe The Breathing I.e.</h3><p>Subsequently the term respiration was used in a wider sense including breathing, transport of gases as well as the oxidation of food leading to liberation of co 2 and energy. Aerobic respiration is more efficient because it uses oxygen to break down glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids and is the primary method the body produces adenosine triphosphate (atp), which provides energy to the muscles. Most of the plant and animal cells use aerobic respiration. So, in the case of aerobic respiration, a larger amount of energy is produced as compared to anaerobic respiration process as complete oxidation takes place.</p>
<h3 id="aerobic-respiration-is-a-highly-efficient-process">Aerobic Respiration Is A Highly Efficient Process.</h3><p>It converts glucose into ethanol and co2. Answers (1) unlike anaerobic respiration, the process of aerobic respiration leads to complete oxidation of substances. If you look at 1 mol which is 180 grams of pure glucose then it can burn or oxidise or react with oxygen to release 686 kcal of energy as heat. However, it provides energy when oxygen is not available or.</p>

<h3 id="it-is-a-process-when-glucose-is-broken-down-to-carbon-dioxide-in-the-presence-of-oxygen-to-produce-energy-in-the-form-of-atp">It Is A Process When Glucose Is Broken Down To Carbon Dioxide In The Presence Of Oxygen To Produce Energy In The Form Of Atp.</h3><p>It is less efficient than aerobic respiration because it produces less energy than aerobic respiration. The fundamental difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is the usage of oxygen in the process of cellular respiration. This forces the cell to undergo the much less efficient fermentation. This type of respiration is common in most of the plants and animals, birds, humans, and other mammals.</p>
