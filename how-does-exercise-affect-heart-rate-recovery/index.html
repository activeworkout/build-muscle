With all the attention paid to the effect that aerobic exercise has on heart rate, you might think the only requirement for an effective workout is to increase your heart rate. Use the timers and stethoscopes again to record how many heartbeats you can hear in 30 seconds. How does exercise affect heart rate? Science for Kids.</p>

<p>A healthy person should see his heart rate decline by 15 to 20 beats per minute in the first minute after stopping exercise. As you exercise more strenuously, the sympathetic system “kicks in” to accelerate your heart rate even more. At the beginning of exercise, your body removes the parasympathetic stimulation, which enables the heart rate to gradually increase. This means the heart beats fewer times per minute than it would in a nonathlete. BSecur Understanding Heart Rate Variability Why Does It Matter? B.</p>

<p>The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit of time). The current study investigated which of four different measures of metabolic and autonomic recovery was most sensitive to changes in. Less attention has been given to the events underlying the fall in heart rate at the cessation of exercise. A cutoff value of 12 beats per minute was found to.
