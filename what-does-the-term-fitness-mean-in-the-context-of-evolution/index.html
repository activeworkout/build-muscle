Fitness evolution of the best genotype found with the algorithm From researchgate.net
A genotype’s fitness depends on the environment in which the organism lives. Depending on the context, it can be described either in terms of genotype or in terms of phenotype in a certain environment. It’s important to realize that the fittest organisms in a particular context won’t necessarily be the ones that satisfy our cultural ideals. Evolutionary fitness is a term that refers to the.
