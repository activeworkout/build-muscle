Muscle power is defined as the product of muscle strength and muscle contractile velocity (work per unit time), and since daily living involves dynamic muscle action, loss of muscle power could have a greater impact on functional muscle limitation than muscle weakness per se [54]. Dynamic stretches are movements performed at a slower pace than most workouts. In other words, the individual uses a swinging or bouncing movement to extend their range of motion (rom) and flexibility. What is the definition of muscular strength?

Muscular strength is a measure of the maximal amount of force that a muscle can produce in one contraction. Muscular strength is one of the most important factors in sports and athletic ability.</p>

<p>Dynamic stretches are movements performed at a slower pace than most workouts. Ballistic exercises are typically classed as having external resistance â for example, medicine ball throws. Muscle power is defined as the product of muscle strength and muscle contractile velocity (work per unit time), and since daily living involves dynamic muscle action, loss of muscle power could have a greater impact on functional muscle limitation than muscle weakness per se [54].
