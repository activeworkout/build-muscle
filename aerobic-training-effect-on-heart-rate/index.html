For cardiac patients aerobic exercise training was associated with more improvement in hrr compared to usual care. The present study has provided further evidence that certain types of aerobic training may affect orthostatic tolerance and may be associated with a loss of complexity of hrv during supine resting and orthostatic stress. Therefore, each time your heart contracts, more blood is pumped to your muscles. We aimed to investigate the effects of endurance training intensity (1) on systolic blood pressure (sbp) and heart rate (hr) at rest before exercise, and during and after a maximal exercise test;
