It is the respiratory process where the electron is transferred to dioxygen molecules (o 2 ), generating water molecules and energy molecule atp. The sugar is completely broken down to carbon dioxide and water, yielding a maximum of 38 molecules of atp per molecule of glucose. This type of respiration is found in plants and animals like birds, humans, etc. So, depending upon oxygen availability, respiration can be aerobic or anaerobic.
