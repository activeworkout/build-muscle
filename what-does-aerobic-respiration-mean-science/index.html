Aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration. 19.5.2 effects of nutrients and calcium source on the concrete properties and need for encapsulation. While cellular respiration (aerobic) requires oxygen to create energy and leaves co2 as a byproduct, photosynthesis uses co2 to create energy and leaves oxygen as a byproduct. (1) urea hydrolysis, (2) aerobic respiration, and (3) nitrate reduction, rely on the formation of calcium carbonate as the healing compound.

<p>In addition, aerobic respiration produces more atp than anaerobic respiration. While cellular respiration (aerobic) requires oxygen to create energy and leaves co2 as a byproduct, photosynthesis uses co2 to create energy and leaves oxygen as a byproduct. In other words, respiration is the key way that a cell gets chemical energy to drive cellular activity.
