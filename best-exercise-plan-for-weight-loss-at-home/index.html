Jumping the rope may seem to be funny as a game, but it is also a serious 5 minutes exercise to lose weight at home. You try to forget how hungry you are, and your stomach starts to growl. Head up and looking straight ahead, engage your core muscles and take a big step forward with one leg. Set a timer for 15 minutes and go from one exercise to the next in a continuous circuit until the buzzer goes off.
