Sometimes, after deadlifting workouts or heavy grip exercises, i am unable to even squeeze or grip light objects because my forearms are too pumped. Any heavy lift or exercise that involves squeezing a bar really hard with a lot of weight attached to it (weight plates or, well, yourself) will make your forearms work and grow. The same is true for the bones in the shanks of the hands. Weight loss happens systemically, which means that your entire body loses weight at the same time.
