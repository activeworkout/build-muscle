<p>The aerobic system, also known as aerobic glycolysis, powers continuous steady state exercise longer than three to four minutes. Aerobic capacity is commonly described by the o 2 max, or maximal oxygen uptake. The fundamental difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is the usage of oxygen in the process of cellular respiration.

<p>It occurs in the inner membrane of the mitochondria. Respiration is of two types, aerobic respiration, and anaerobic respiration. In the aerobic system energy (atp) is produced through pyruvic acid and lipid/protein fragments entering the kreb cycle and the electron transport cycle (mcardle, 1991). Phosphorylation is defined as the process of formation of atp during a process. What Is Aerobic Endurance? Definition, Test &amp; Training MYPROTEIN™.</p>

<p>Aerobic endurance is the body’s ability to sustain medium to high intensity physical exercise for extended periods of time through the continual acquasition of oxygen. Your cardiovascular fitness level is measured in terms of the amount of oxygen pumped by your heart throughout your body to your active muscles. Aerobic endurance training is any form of training that uses oxygen to meet energy demands and is generally performed at a light to moderate intensity.
