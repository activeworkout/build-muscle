<p>It occurs in the inner membrane of the mitochondria. Respiration is of two types, aerobic respiration, and anaerobic respiration. In the aerobic system energy (atp) is produced through pyruvic acid and lipid/protein fragments entering the kreb cycle and the electron transport cycle (mcardle, 1991).

<p>Aerobic endurance is the bodyâs ability to sustain medium to high intensity physical exercise for extended periods of time through the continual acquasition of oxygen. Your cardiovascular fitness level is measured in terms of the amount of oxygen pumped by your heart throughout your body to your active muscles. Aerobic endurance training is any form of training that uses oxygen to meet energy demands and is generally performed at a light to moderate intensity.
