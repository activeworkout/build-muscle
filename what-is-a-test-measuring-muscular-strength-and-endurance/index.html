<meta name="description" content="Simple What Is A Test Measuring Muscular Strength And Endurance For Women, In simpler words, muscular endurance is the energy your muscles have that relates to the duration you’re able to perform a certain exercise. The pushup test assesses the strength and endurance of the chest and triceps muscles, whereas the crunch test assesses the strength and endurance of the abdomen muscles.
