<p>Vascular tissue is an arrangement of multiple cell types in vascular plants which allows for the transport of water, minerals, and products of photosynthesis to be transported throughout the plant. The plant vascular system is a complicated network of conducting tissues that interconnects all organs and transports water, minerals, nutrients, organic compounds, and various signaling molecules throughout the plant body. The system is composed of canals connecting numerous tube feet.echinoderms move by alternately contracting muscles that force water into the tube feet, causing them to extend and push against the. 300,000 accepted known species) that have lignified tissues (the xylem) for conducting water and.
