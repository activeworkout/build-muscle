More blood means more blood flow and that. Muscle within the heart is referred to as ‘cardiac muscle’ and predominantly operates autonomously. In one study, older adults who engaged in regular exercise experienced an 8.4 percent reduction in resting heart rate. The long term effect of exercise is that cardiac output will increase which means that the delivery of oxygen and other nutrients around the body is more effective and participant can perform for longer and the oxygen debt time is less than a normal person.
