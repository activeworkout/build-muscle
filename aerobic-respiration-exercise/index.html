Aerobic exercise is broadly defined as “any type of exercise performed at moderate levels of intensity, for extended periods of time, that maintains an increased heart rate.”.
What is aerobic respiration? BBC Bitesize From bbc.com
This process is called aerobic respiration. An aerobic exercise is one that can be maintained at a moderate pace or intensity to use oxygen at the same rate that oxygen can be replenished in working muscle groups. Oxygen is present when this form of respiration takes place. Oxygen is present when this form of respiration takes place.

<p>Aerobic exercise is broadly defined as “any type of exercise performed at moderate levels of intensity, for extended periods of time, that maintains an increased heart rate.”. Aerobic respiration is the process by which organisms use oxygen to turn fuel, such as fats and sugars, into chemical energy. Walks the simplest exercise that exists, of great aerobic performance and that is realized through long sessions in which the respiratory and cardiovascular apparatus works incessantly, burning fats and carbohydrates. It produces carbon dioxide and water as well as releasing useful cellular energy. Swimming as Anaerobic Exercise Healthy Living.</p>
