Aerobic exercise is defined as any form of physical activity that produces an increased heart rate and respiratory volume to meet the oxygen requirements Increase aerobic fitness in sedentary young males, but a supramaximal exercise session had no significant effects on lipid metabolism in studied participants [6]. Aerobic exercise is recommended for improving lipoprotein and lipid levels which at less than their optimal levels are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Increase aerobic fitness in sedentary young males, but a supramaximal exercise session had no significant effects on lipid metabolism in studied participants [6].
