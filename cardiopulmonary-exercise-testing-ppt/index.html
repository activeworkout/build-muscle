Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpet) is an exercise test for analyzing both diagnostic and prognostic assessment by evaluating both submaximal and peak exercise response involving the pulmonary, cardiovascular, hematopoietic, neuropsychological, and skeletal muscle systems&amp;#91;1&amp;#93;, cpet is aimed at the evaluation of exercise performance, functional. The rate at which those factors are increased is referred to as the “ramp” and it tells us how much the watts will increase per minute during the test. It has been used in the assessment of elite athletes and for the diagnosis of dyspnoea for which it is now recognised as the gold standard. • continuous at, or slightly below, at • at intervals:
