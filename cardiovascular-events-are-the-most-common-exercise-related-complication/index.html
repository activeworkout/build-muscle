Among these, cardiovascular complications are the most common and in some cases the most dangerous. Improves the muscles’ ability to pull oxygen out of the blood, reducing the need for the heart to pump more blood to the muscles. These arrhythmias commonly produce symptoms, including: It is estimated that 82 percent of people who die of coronary heart disease are 65 and older.
