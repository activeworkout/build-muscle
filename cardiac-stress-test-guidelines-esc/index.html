Ongoing technological advances that have led to a wide use of imaging techniques and development of new guidelines have called for a revised and updated approach to the technique and interpretation of the ecg exercise testing. Exercise testing is widely available and relatively low in cost. Consult with attending physician as needed. Electrocardiographic (ecg) exercise stress test has been a major diagnostic test in cardiology for several decades.
