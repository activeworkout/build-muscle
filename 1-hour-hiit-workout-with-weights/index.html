1 Hour HIIT WALKING WORKOUT for Weight Loss Walk at HOME to BURN From youtube.com
Add one round every two weeks, increase the number of repeats in your hiit workouts from 6 to 10 by week 8. However, you’ll be used to it gradually. 1 hour hiit workout research shows you can achieve more progress in a mere 15 minutes of interval training done three times a week than the person jogging on the treadmill for an hour. Including weights in a hiit workout is one of the best ways to increase the challenge and maximise the effectiveness of the exercises.
