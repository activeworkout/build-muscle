One of the most important differences of the aerobic and anaerobic energy system is the speed of the production of energy. It is a cyclic aerobic process taking place in the matrix of mitochondria to break down pyruvic acid into carbon dioxide in the presence of certain enzymes. Limitations a single negative culture does not rule out infection. Aerobic incubation, total counts, sterility test, purity test, cleaning control.

The anaerobic system delivers energy significantly faster, and will therefore deliver a greater part of the energy when the intensity is higher.
