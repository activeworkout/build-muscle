One of the most important differences of the aerobic and anaerobic energy system is the speed of the production of energy. It is a cyclic aerobic process taking place in the matrix of mitochondria to break down pyruvic acid into carbon dioxide in the presence of certain enzymes. Limitations a single negative culture does not rule out infection. Aerobic incubation, total counts, sterility test, purity test, cleaning control.

<p>Inoculation is performed within a short time. Respiration is used by all cells to turn fuel into energy that can be used to power cellular processes. The anaerobic system delivers energy significantly faster, and will therefore deliver a greater part of the energy when the intensity is higher.
