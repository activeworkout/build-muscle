<p>It is where blood flow through closed vessels: In a closed circulatory system, the blood is enclosed in the blood vessels, namely, arteries, veins, capillaries, or directly in the heart. Whereas in an open circulatory system, the blood, known as hemolymph, flows freely in body cavities known as a hemocoel. While arteries carry blood away from the heart, the veins (in most cases) carry blood back to the heart.</p>
