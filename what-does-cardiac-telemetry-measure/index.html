A heart telemetry and recording is expected to help doctors continuously monitor all of a patient’s cardiac activities for a long time. Unlike a holter monitor which records every single heartbeat for 24 hours, mct and event monitors only record (and store in their memories) abnormal cardiac rhythms. Telemetry is the local collection of measurements (or other data) at remote points, and their automatic transmission to receiving equipment for monitoring. While both ekgs and telemetry monitor a patient’s unique electrocardiogram for a period long.
