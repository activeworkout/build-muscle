Why Is Your Weight Fluctuating On The Scale? Eat, Lose, Gain From ericamesirov.com
Another reason you could be gaining weight working out is that you’re building muscle faster than you’re shedding fat. If you start to change your body composition with your workouts — by building more dense muscle mass and decreasing your body fat — your scale weight may increase, while your body fat percentage may decrease. If it was not then i’ve wasted a large part of my life haha. A pound of muscle is much smaller than a pound of fat, which is where this misconception comes from.
