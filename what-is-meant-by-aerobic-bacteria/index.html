Bacteria, Aerobic; Aerobic Bacteria From lookfordiagnosis.com
Aerobic bacteria are bacteria that can grow and live when oxygen is present. In our bactrex and mycotrex products are both biological agents that will introduce beneficial bacteria to the roots of a cannabis plant, or any plant with a root system for that matter. Aerobic bacteria refers to the group of microorganisms that grow in the presence of oxygen and thrive in the anoxygenic environment. Bacteria that grow in the presence of o2, which are the most common causes of clinical infection.
