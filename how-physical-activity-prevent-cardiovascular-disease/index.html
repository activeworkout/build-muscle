<p>This review surveys data from observational studies supporting the premise that physical activity, exercise training, and improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness are essential elements in the prevention and treatment of the cardiovascular diseases induced by an environment in which survival no longer obligates physical exertion. At the endothelial level, this decreased incidence was attributed to higher expression and phosphorylation of the endothelial isoform of no synthase, which results in a more effective radical scavenger system, a rejuvenation of the endothelium by circulating. Regular exercise also helps keep arteries and other blood vessels flexible, ensuring good blood circulation and normal.
