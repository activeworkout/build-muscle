<p>With cardio, in general, you're gonna be burning more calories regardless compared the strength training, again, unless you're doing like circuit training at a pretty intense level. The resistance training group lifted weights for an hour 3 times a week (60 minutes per session). Cardio doesn’t burn more fat than lifting weights. Lifting loads normally prompts higher epoc levels than cardio, bringing about more critical muscle breakdown.</p>
