1.2.2 Lesson 4 long term effects part 2 From slideshare.net
On starting and maintaining regular exercise in the long term, you may notice your resting heart rate gradually start to drop. You can estimate your maximum heart rate by subtracting your age from 220. What happens to the resting heart rate as a result of regular endurance exercise? Activity might be the mediating effect of resting heart rate (rhr):

<p>As your heart gets stronger with training, it pumps more blood with each beat, resulting in an increase in stroke volume. This effect is due to increased activity in your vagus nerve, which acts to slow down the heart at rest.

<p>The stress from exercise helps you maintain healthy muscles and lungs, as well as cardiovascular (the heart and blood vessels) health. Decrease in resting heart rate. Because exercise has been shown to improve autonomic tone, it stands to reason that perhaps exercise training can improve abnormal heart rate recovery.

<p>To achieve a lower resting heart rate from exercise, you should exercise at least 150 minutes a week in your aerobic zone. The heart eventually becomes more efficient, and no longer needs to beat as quickly to supply the body with blood while at rest. As your heart gets stronger with training, it pumps more blood with each beat, resulting in an increase in stroke volume.
