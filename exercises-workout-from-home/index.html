Best Home Ab Workouts to Build Six Pack From abmachinesguide.com
I like this exercise because it doubles for a forearm workout as well. As you stand, press the dumbbells overhead, straightening your elbows completely. This is a workout you can do at home just using a set of dumbbells and barbells. Keep your core engaged and hips tucked under.
