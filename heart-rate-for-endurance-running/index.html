The testing protocols for all three metrics are listed below. Running training plans should include a variety of different types of runs based on these heart rate zones. While heart rate is fine to use as a training metric in some cases, two reasons often cited where it falls short is in regard to heat and cardiac drift. Some studies suggest a correlation between endurance training and atrial fibrillation (afib), a potentially dangerous heart condition.
