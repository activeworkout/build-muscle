The bidirectional glenn (bdg) shunt, or bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis, is a surgical technique used in pediatric cardiac surgery procedure used to temporarily improve blood oxygenation for patients with a congenital cardiac defect resulting in a single functional ventricle. The glenn procedure is done after the norwood procedure and before the fontan procedure.it also is the second surgery for patients with complex single ventricles.

<p>The glenn procedure is an open heart procedure performed on patients with tricupis atresia (as illustrated in the image (1), where there is no tricuspid valve and thus, no value between the right atria and right ventricle; Bdg is performed in patients with anatomical or functional single ventricle, as a palliative procedure. Creation of a bidirectional shunt reduces the amount of blood. Now the blood from the upper part of the body flows directly into the pulmonary artery.

<p>The glenn procedure is the second of three surgeries for patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (hlhs). The glenn procedure, the way it is currently performed involves hooking up the superior vena cava to the right pulmonary artery and detaching it from the right atrium. The bidirectional glenn (bdg) shunt, or bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis, is a surgical technique used in pediatric cardiac surgery procedure used to temporarily improve blood oxygenation for patients with a congenital cardiac defect resulting in a single functional ventricle.

<p>The bidirectional glenn (bdg) shunt, or bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis, is a surgical technique used in pediatric cardiac surgery procedure used to temporarily improve blood oxygenation for patients with a congenital cardiac defect resulting in a single functional ventricle. This procedure is usually done for patients with either a single ventricle or a functionally single ventricle (other ventricle very small or obstructed). A bilateral glenn procedure was performed in 12.5% of the cases and 10.3% were carried out without using a cardiopulmonary bypass pump.
