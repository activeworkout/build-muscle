<p>The glenn procedure is an open heart procedure performed on patients with tricupis atresia (as illustrated in the image (1), where there is no tricuspid valve and thus, no value between the right atria and right ventricle; Bdg is performed in patients with anatomical or functional single ventricle, as a palliative procedure. Creation of a bidirectional shunt reduces the amount of blood. Now the blood from the upper part of the body flows directly into the pulmonary artery.
