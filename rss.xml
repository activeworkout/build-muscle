Since cycling and running are built more for burning calories, it’s hard to put on muscle when doing these activities. 15 miles of cycling is equal to 5 miles of running at the same effort level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 23 Step What Does Fat Burn On My Fitbit Mean For Weight Loss&lt;/strong&gt;, A high intensity cardio workout for me would burn about 600 calories in 30 minutes, so for you to be burning 3,500 in a day (i assume) it must include the calories you would be burning as part of your everyday metabolism. So the number you see on your tracker (or in your fitbit app) first thing in the morning is your estimated calorie burn for the day so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; src=&#34;https://activeworkout.github.io/img/placeholder.svg&#34; data-src=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/reviewposition.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/fitbitcharge3_13-800x533.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Fitbit Charge 3 vs Fitbit Alta HR Comparison Review Position&#34; title=&#34;Fitbit Charge 3 vs Fitbit Alta HR Comparison Review Position&#34; onerror=&#34;this.onerror=null;this.src=&#39;https:\/\/activeworkout.github.io\/img\/placeholder.svg&#39;;&#34; class=&#34;center&#34; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fat burn zone is also known as the training zone, it is a margin of where the body will start to burn energy more efficiently. At that rate you’d need 90 walking. Fitbit doesn’t know how many calories you burn, and you don’t either. Moderate (50 to 69 percent of your max hr) benefit:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
