High Intensity Interval Training Heart Rate Zones Rating Walls From ratingwalls.blogspot.com
Intensity during the high intensity work interval should range ≥ 80% of your estimated maximal heart rate. For example, i’m 37 years old, so my hiit heart rate target zone would be calculated as follows: After surgery, patients have lower aerobic power (vo 2 max) and compensatory hemodynamic responses. If you don&#39;t have a heart rate monitor, check your breathing.
