Catabolism - Wikipedia From en.wikipedia.org
Anabolism refers to the process which builds molecules the body needs; The anabolic process releases energy while catabolic processes require energy. Catabolism breaks down large molecules (such as polysaccharides, lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins) into smaller units (such as monosaccharides, fatty acids, nucleotides, and amino. At any moment both reactions are occurring.

<p>Anabolism builds molecules required by the body to function while catabolism is the breakdown of big complex molecules into smaller molecules for easier absorption. The main difference between aerobic and anaerobic process is that in an aerobic process, molecular oxygen occurs inside the cell whereas, in an anaerobic process, molecular oxygen is absent inside the cell. Catabolism, at its core, involves breaking down of complex molecules and releasing energy for the body to use. Catabolic exercises are largely aerobic, meaning they consume oxygen, and help burn calories and fat.</p>
