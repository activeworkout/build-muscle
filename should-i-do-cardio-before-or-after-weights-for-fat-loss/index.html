<p>The debate over whether cardio should come before or after weights has been going on for years. Most people with fat loss goals, in addition to their lifting program, do at least 3 to 4 days a week of formal cardio, usually 30 to 60 minutes at a moderate to moderately hard intensity (enough to get heart rate and breathing up). Weightlifting with a portion of the body combined with cardio will also increase the pounds you lose. Hence, doing cardio prior to weight training with the intent of fat loss is counterproductive because the body can’t tap into its fat stores until its glycogen stores are burned off, and cardio can’t do that as effectively as weight training does.
