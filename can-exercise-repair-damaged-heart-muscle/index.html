That’s why the rapid healing that follows a heart attack creates scar tissue in place of working muscle tissue. The stem cells, which are often taken from bone marrow, may be inserted into the heart using a catheter. Can you repair heart damage naturally? Vigorous daily exercise can repair damage caused due to a heart attack by activating dormant stem cells, leading to the development of new cardiac muscle, according to a new study.
