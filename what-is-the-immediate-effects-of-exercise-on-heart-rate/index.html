<p>The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit. [subjects and methods] subjects were randomly assigned to an exercise group (n=12) or a control group (n=11). The heart pumps more blood per beat.

<p>Students work in groups to develop a hypothesis about how exercise affects the heart rate. Therefore, their heart needs less beats to pump the oxygenated blood to the muscles in need of it. This effect is due to increased activity in your vagus nerve, which acts to slow down the heart at rest.
