<p>âcardio after weights is a safer bet than cardio before weights, not only for energy levels, but also for potentiating fat loss,â says lee boyce, c.p.t., owner of boyce training. Hiit is a type of workout that requires you to give maximal efforts for a designated interval of time. The burpees engages all the muscles in your body and is mainly targeted to build calves, chest, triceps, shoulder, biceps, glutes, and lats. If you exercise every day, 30 to 45 minutes of cardio workout will help you lose weight faster than any other fitness regimen.</p>
