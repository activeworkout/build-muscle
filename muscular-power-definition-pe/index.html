<p>Muscular strength is increased by performing progressive resistance training over time to improve the endurance of the muscle. The long duration force exertion capability of a muscle is called muscle endurance. Power is defined as the amount of work performed per unit of time. While strength is the maximal force you can apply against a load, power is proportional to the speed at which you can apply this maximal force. What is muscular endurance and how do you improve it?
