To test how much aerobic exercise raises the heat beat of a people, a person will take there resting heart rate, this is the heart rate of a person before doing any form of strenuous activity, for 1 minute using a stop watch, to make sure it is accurate.

Also, first improve your cardio via some basic aerobic training, before stepping up the intensity with fast paced cardio exercises. A young, healthy athlete may have a heart rate of 30 to 40 bpm. Exercise or physical activities help in handling all this by increasing basal metabolic rate (bmr). In anaerobic exercise, such as weightlifting and sprinting, your body’s need for oxygen exceeds the oxygen that is available.
