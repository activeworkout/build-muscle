<p>(heart muscle, nlm, medical subject headings) severe interruption of the blood supply to the myocardial tissue may result in necrosis of cardiac muscle (myocardial infarction). The muscle forming the myocardium, consisting of anastomosing transversely striated muscle fibers formed of cells united at intercalated discs. These inner and outer layers of the heart, respectively, surround the cardiac muscle tissue and separate it from the blood and other organs.
