<p>The bodyâs demand for oxygen changes, such as during exercise, and the cardiac output is altered by modulating both heart rate (hr) and stroke volume (sv). This process is measured by a term called âcardiac output,â which determines the amount of blood pumped by the heart in a given minute. Why is maintaining cardiac output so important?

<p>3,4 such a balance between co and total peripheral resistance would be considered. Regular exercise improves venous return by increasing total blood volume, increasing end diastolic volume, and increasing the size and contractile strength of the heart muscle. Generally speaking, your heart beats both faster and stronger to increase cardiac output during exercise. Heart rate increases proportionately with workload until heart rates close to maximal are attained. Exertional dyspnoea and syncope The BMJ.</p>

<p>During exercise, your body may need three or four times your normal cardiac output, because your muscles need more oxygen when you exert yourself. The human body must pump blood throughout itself to provide oxygen and nutrients for the brain and other components for the human body to function properly.
