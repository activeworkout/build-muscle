Anaerobic Exercise vs Aerobic Exercise MUSCLE INSIDER From muscleinsider.com
The maximal amount of physiological work that an individual can do as measured by oxygen consumption. It is determined by a combination of aging and cardiovascular conditioning and is associated with the efficiency of oxygen extraction from the tissue. Aerobic capacity, also known as cardiopulmonary capacity, cardiorespiratory fitness, or vo2 max, is a measurement of your maximum oxygen consumption during physical activity. This measurement is an indication of (1) the ability of the cardiovascular system to provide oxygen to working muscles and (2) the ability of those muscles to extract oxygen for energy generation in the form of adenosine triphosphate (atp).

<p>If an individual performs regular exercise, his residual air capacity increases in comparison to an individual who does not perform regular exercise. Aerobic capacity denotes a general extent of metabolic processes occurring in the human organism, and stands for a larger portion of the total energetic capacity. With this in mind, which of the two should be prioritised is really a matter of what sport you play and the type of athlete you are.

<p>The anaerobic capacity is the amount of energy that is obtained from anaerobic energy systems. While cardio training is most often associated with fat loss, it is also the best way to improve aerobic capacity, which is the ability to use oxygen to fuel exercise activity. This measurement is an indication of (1) the ability of the cardiovascular system to provide oxygen to working muscles and (2) the ability of those muscles to extract oxygen for energy generation in the form of adenosine triphosphate (atp). Aerobic capacity denotes a general extent of metabolic processes occurring in the human organism, and stands for a larger portion of the total energetic capacity. Aerobic Capacity lesson 2.</p>
