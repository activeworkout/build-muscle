Discuss with your doctor these speculations and see if any better reasoning comes up. Igm is our first defense against bacteria, so if you have an active infection it can be the cause of this elevation. Since igm are antibodies formed in response to a first time infection, high levels could mean a new infection. An antibody is a substance in your blood that helps fight infection.

<p>A negative result means only that the cardiolipin antibody class tested (igg, igm, and/or iga) is not present at this time. Lesser levels of igg and igm phospholipid (cardiolipin) antibodies and antibodies of the iga isotype may occur in patients with clinical signs of aps but the results. When you see excessive blood clot, then the symptoms and signs may differ based on the location of the clot. Slightly or moderately positive results are sometimes temporarily.</p>

<p>Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them for just a short while due to an infection or drug, or present but without symptoms as a person ages. Discuss with your doctor these speculations and see if any better reasoning comes up.

<p>The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). There are three types of anticardiolipin antibodies: I believe the dosage at that time was smaller than that which he gave me for most of the treatment, which has been 850mg.
