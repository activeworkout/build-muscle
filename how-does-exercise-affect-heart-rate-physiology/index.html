<p>As we make more blood vessels, there are more places for blood to flow, which results in more efficient circulation. At rest, our nervous system maintains a parasympathetic tone, which affects the respiratory rate, cardiac output, and various metabolic processes. The heart rate increases because of a decrease in parasympathetic activity of sa node combined with increased sympathetic activity. Methods 10 healthy male subjects were studied at rest, during static exercise performed at 30% of maximal voluntary contraction (sx30), and during dynamic cycling exercises done at 30% of v̇o2max (dx30) and at 60% of v̇o2max (dx60).</p>

<p>The following will be covered: The cardiovascular response to exercise consists of a massive increase in cardiac output combined with a massive decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, predominantly of the skeletal muscle vascular beds. Heart rate increases as you exercise to deliver more blood and oxygen to your working muscles. Intense exercise causes a steeper increase in your heart rate than moderate exercise.

The direct relationship between exercise and respiratory rate is that you will begin to take in more oxygen — about three to four times as much, to be exact.

Reduces stress hormones that can put an extra burden on the heart works like a beta blocker to. This demand will cause sympathetic nerves to stimulate the heart to beat faster and with more force to increase overall blood flow.

<p>The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit of time).
