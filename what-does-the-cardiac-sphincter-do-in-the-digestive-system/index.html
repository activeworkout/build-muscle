<p>The sphincter of oddi (also hepatopancreatic sphincter or glissonâs sphincter), abbreviated as so, is a muscular valve that in some animals, including humans, controls the flow of digestive juices (bile and pancreatic juice) out of the pancreas through the ampulla of vater into the second part of the duodenum. The role of the cardiac sphincter is to stop the flow of material back into the esophagus. Sphincters are circular muscles that serve as valves to open and close certain parts of the body. It also prevents stomach acid from backing up into the esophagus.</p>
