Why Does Exercise Affect Blood Pressure ExerciseWalls From exercisewalls.blogspot.com
Improves the muscles’ ability to pull oxygen out of the blood, reducing the need for the heart to pump more blood to the muscles. Compared with the usual care group, the exercisers lowered their systolic blood pressure (the first number in a reading) by an average of 7.1 points and their diastolic blood pressure (the second number) by 5.1 points. During exercise, the heart must beat faster to eliminate excess carbon dioxide and increase the supply of oxygen in the body. More oxygen is also going to the muscles.
