The myogenic response is defined either as constriction of a vessel in response to an increase in transmural pressure, or stretch, or as dilation in response to a decrease in pressure [21].the myogenic responsiveness of coronary arterioles is truly myogenic, meaning it arises from an inherent response in the smooth muscle myocytes, and myogenic reactions are generally.

<p>In the human heart, contraction is initiated by a special modified heart muscle known as sinoatrial node. Myogenic adjective (1) arising in or referring to muscle. Since the heartbeat is initiated by the sa node and the impulse of contraction originates in the heart itself, the human heart is termed as myogenic. The myogenic response is defined either as constriction of a vessel in response to an increase in transmural pressure, or stretch, or as dilation in response to a decrease in pressure [21].the myogenic responsiveness of coronary arterioles is truly myogenic, meaning it arises from an inherent response in the smooth muscle myocytes, and myogenic reactions are generally.

<p>Each contraction of the heart muscle regulates the flow of blood in the form of a pulse or heart rate. Take the heart for example, if you take cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells) out of the body and keep them alive in a suitable medium, they will continue to contract. The human heart is known for its predominant function of pumping blood to parts of the body. The sa node has the inherent power of generating a wave of contraction and controlling the heartbeat.
