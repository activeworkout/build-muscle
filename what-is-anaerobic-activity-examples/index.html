Aerobic exercise and Anaerobic exercise From slideshare.net
Anaerobic literally means “without air,” so anaerobic exercise is an intense exercise that requires the body to use other sources of energy besides oxygen to fuel the muscles. You’re maximizing the amount of oxygen in. In fact, anaerobic means absence of oxygen. this can be contrasted with aerobic exercise that consumes oxygen at a sustainable pace such that an activity can be continued for a long duration of time. Certain circumstances require the body to produce energy faster than oxygen delivery can take place.
