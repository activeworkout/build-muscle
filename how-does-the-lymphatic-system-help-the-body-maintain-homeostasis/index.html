Body systems and homeostasis From slideshare.net
Digestive system the digestive system helps maintain homeostasis by making sure the body has enough nutrients and gets rid of waste. The mouth processes and absorbs nutrients from the food we eat. The mouth (including the tongue) and the tailbone (sacrum). As blood passes through the tiny capillaries in the alveolar sacs, changing pressure gradients allow oxygen and carbon dioxide to diffuse in and out of the blood.
