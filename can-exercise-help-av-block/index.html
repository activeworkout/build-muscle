The atria is pumping the blood through but the ventricles are dropping the ball and not pumping it out. To our knowledge, this is the first case report to describe exercise induced transient av node block in. There are three types of heart blocks. Type 1 improves whereas type 2 deteriorates with exercise, because the vagolytic effect of exercise does not have any influence on type 2 av block (distally located beyond vagal influence).
