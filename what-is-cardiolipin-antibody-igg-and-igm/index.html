Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of blood fat that is important for blood clotting. There are three types of anticardiolipin antibodies: Cardiolipin antibodies (igg&#43;igm) cardiolipin antibodies (igg&#43;igm) code. Phospholipid (cardiolipin) antibodies must be detected on 2 or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart to fulfill the laboratory diagnostic criteria for aps.

When you see excessive blood clot, then the symptoms and signs may differ based on the location of the clot.
