<p>In aerobic respiration, atp forms as electrons are harvested and transferred along the electron transport chain, and eventually donated to oxygen gas. The process by which the body uses oxygen in order to make food separate into the substances it consists of and produce energy. The term now refers to the overall process by which oxygen is abstracted from air and is transported to the cells for the oxidation of organic molecules while carbon dioxide (co2) and water, the products of oxidation, are returned to the environment. Aerobic respiration is important because it is the primary way that your cells produce energy.</p>
