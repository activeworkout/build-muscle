However, the fitbit shows me at peak heart rate for extended periods of time, sometimes 30&#43; minutes. That is the maximum rate your heart should beat while exercising. The number that you arrive at is considered your peak heart rate while exercising. Roughly 65% of the calories you burn are fat.

<p>As you become more physically fit, your heart will beat fewer times per minute because it has become efficient.

<p>1 in general, and with some exceptions, a lower resting heart rate indicates a higher degree of fitness. Roughly 65% of the calories you burn are fat. 50 to 60 percent of maximum heart rate.

<p>However, this zone does more to improve heart capacity and cardiovascular performance as opposed to burning fat calories. If you are 40 years old, for instance, this formula will tell you that your target range for healthy exercise is about 108 to 144 beats a minute. It is not sustainable since it is an all out effort.

<p>208 minus (age x 0.7) = maximum heart rate. This will help you improve your cardiorespiratory fitness. When you exercise at the highest possible intensity, your heart will reach maximal heart rate (hrmax), the fastest rate it.

<p>Strenuous exercise, such as weightlifting, can cause this temporary increase in heart rate that exceeds the maximum rate. As you become more physically fit, your heart will beat fewer times per minute because it has become efficient. You can estimate your maximum heart rate based on your age. At an 85 percent level of exertion, your target would be 145 beats per minute. Peak heart rate (HR peak) expressed as a percentage of maximal heart.</p>

<p>The heartbeat rate is generally calculated on the basis of the reading scored on a. That is why it is easier to say that a safe upper limit is 60% to 90% of your maximum heart rate rather than us trying to provide you with a specific number. What this means is that if you are 58 then your exercise heart rate should be 162, 80% of that is 129. This is the very low intensity zone. Heart rate during the two experimental trials.

<p>Training at this intensity will boost your recovery and get you ready to train in the higher heart rate zones. The standard running target heart rate zones are defined as follows: However, this zone does more to improve heart capacity and cardiovascular performance as opposed to burning fat calories.

Maximum heart rate is the highest beats per minute your heart can achieve. To determine your target heart rate, subtract your age from 220. What this means is that if you are 58 then your exercise heart rate should be 162, 80% of that is 129.</p>
