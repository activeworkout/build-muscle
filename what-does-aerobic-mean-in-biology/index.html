The main difference between aerobic and anaerobic process is that in an aerobic process, molecular oxygen occurs inside. The anaerobic bacteria definition does not require oxygen for its survival. For example, bacteria that need oxygen to grow are called aerobic bacteria. Aerobic is the opposite of anaerobic.
