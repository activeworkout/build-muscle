Heart rate and heart rate variability responses to submaximal exercise From researchgate.net
In the present study, we investigated the relation between cognitive performance and heart rate variability as a function of fitness level. A recent randomized control trial conducted in 2021 evaluated the best breathing technique to improve hrv. That said, there isn’t much research comparing one exercise protocol to another.

<p>Heart rate variability, on the other hand, measures the specific changes in time between successive heart beats. Strenuous activity reduces hrv in the short term, so it is essential not to consistently. Chronic exercise training produces a resting bradycardia that is thought to be due partly to enhanced vagal modulation. Heart rate variability is most accurately measured with an electrocardiogram (ecg or ekg)—a test that provides a graph of your heartbeat from electrodes placed on your chest, arms, and legs.
