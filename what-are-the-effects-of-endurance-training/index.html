Effects of Dietary Supplements on Adaptations to Endurance Training From sasma.org.za
These improvements allow the body to have the oxygen needed to oxidize glycogen and fat. Athletes who engage in cardiovascular endurance training see many positive changes to both their gym and everyday life. Apparently, sem training effects on intermittent exhaustive performance appear to be drastically different depending on the population recruited, though it should be taken into account that, compared to the present, in the study by mohr et al. Endurance training has known effects on the heart and lungs including cardiac hypertrophy, a decreased resting heart rate, increased stroke volume, and increased skeletal capillary density and hypertrophy (3).
