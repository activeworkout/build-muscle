Aerobic Energy System YouTube From youtube.com
Aerobic definition, (of an organism or tissue) requiring the presence of air or free oxygen for life. This energy system can extend out work for hours or sometimes days. In contrast, anaerobic respiration does not use oxygen. Aerobic respiration is the process by which organisms use oxygen to turn fuel, such as fats and sugars, into chemical energy.
