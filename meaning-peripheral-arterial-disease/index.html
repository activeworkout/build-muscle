Claudication Symptoms and causes Mayo Clinic From mayoclinic.org
Peripheral arterial disease (pad) is the name given to occlusive disease that occurs in the peripheral or outer arteries of the body, such as the legs. Peripheral artery disease (pad) is an abnormal narrowing of arteries other than those that supply the heart or brain. Blood pressure should be uniform throughout the whole body, so if pressure is higher in the arm than the leg, it means there’s less blood flowing to the legs, which can indicate blockage. Pvd comprises diseases of both peripheral arteries and peripheral veins.

<p>Peripheral arterial disease is usually caused by atherosclerosis which is a process during which fats and other substances in the blood (such as calcium, dead cells, and platelets) form a fatty deposit called a plaque, narrowing and hardening the artery and restricting blood flow. The drug cilostazol thins the blood and widens blood vessels. Pvd comprises diseases of both peripheral arteries and peripheral veins. Both pad and coronary artery disease are caused by atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries. Peripheral Vascular Disease Treatment in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>

<p>Peripheral arterial disease (pad), also called peripheral vascular disease (pvd), is a narrowing of the arteries. Peripheral arterial disease can decrease blood flow to the legs and feet, resulting in muscle fatigue and pain when walking and can lead to amputation, disability and. Pvd is sometimes incorrectly used as a synonym for peripheral artery disease (pad).

<p>This restricts the blood flow to the arms, kidneys, stomach, and legs causing a range of symptoms. This narrowing and stiffening of the arteries means less blood can flow through them, restricting the blood. Peripheral artery disease is related to reduced blood flow to the limbs.
