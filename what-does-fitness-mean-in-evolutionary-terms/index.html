What does fitness mean in evolutionary terms? (1 days ago) in evolutionary biology, the term “fitness” refers to an organism’s capacity to pass on its genetic material to its children through reproduction. Others pupate on green stems or leaves. Fitness is a measure of how well organisms survive and reproduce with emphasis on “reproduce.” officially fitness is defined as the number of offspring that organisms with a particular genotype or phenotype leave behind on average as compared to others in the population.

<p>Evolutionary fitness is how well a species is able to survive and reproduce in its environment. What does fitness mean when speaking terms of evolution quizlet? Certain traits will have been lost from the gene pool forever. (1 days ago) in evolutionary biology, the term “fitness” refers to an organism’s capacity to pass on its genetic material to its children through reproduction.

<p>So if brown beetles consistently leave more offspring than green beetles because of their color, you’d say that the brown beetles had a higher fitness. Others pupate on green stems or leaves. In evolutionary terms, “fitness” refers to an organism’s ability to reproduce successfully or to have the potential to reproduce successfully — in other words, its ability to contribute to the gene pool of its species. Two distinct colour forms of the pupae are found, namely brown and green, with very few intermediates. Fitness Definition Biology FitnessRetro.</p>
