<p>Total viable count (tvc) is a test that estimates the total numbers of microorganisms, such as bacteria, yeast or mould species, that are present in a water sample. The aerobic plate count (apc) is also known as standard plate count, aerobic mesophilic count, total plate count or aerobic colony count. A sample to be counted is diluted in a solution that will not harm the microbe, yet does not support its growth (so they do not grow during the analysis). The significance of the microbiological tests that may be conducted is discussed below.</p>

<p>A viable cell count allows one to identify the number of actively growing/dividing cells in a sample. Why are only plates with 30 300 colonies counted? Here at express micro science we use tvc (total viable count) but other common terms are apc (aerobic plate count) and acc (aerobic colony count). A sample to be counted is diluted in a solution that will not harm the microbe, yet does not support its growth (so they do not grow during the analysis). Presentation 5.</p>

<p>A sample to be counted is diluted in a solution that will not harm the microbe, yet does not support its growth (so they do not grow during the analysis). One of the most common methods of determining cell number is the viable plate count. Therefore, it counts both living and dead cells. The key difference between total cell count and viable cell count is that total cell count estimates all cells including both living and dead microbial cells in a sample while viable cell count estimates only the living microbial cells in a sample.

<p>The colony becomes visible to the naked eye and the number of colonies on a plate can be counted. Dilution factors may exaggerate low counts (less than 25), and crowded plates (greater than 250) may be difficult to count or may inhibit the growth of some bacteria, resulting in a low count.
