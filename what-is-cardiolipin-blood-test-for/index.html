Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of blood fat that is important for blood clotting. These autoantibodies can affect the body’s ability to regulate blood clotting in a way that is not well understood. When the antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can occur. When you see excessive blood clot, then the symptoms and signs may differ based on the location of the clot.
