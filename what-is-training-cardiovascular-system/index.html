Means to maintain a constant internal body temperature. Cardiovascular training is an intentional exercise that improves the ability of the heart, lungs, and blood vessels to deliver oxygen to the rest of the body. Endurance training or aerobic training, involves working for an extended period of time (usually 10&#43; minutes) at a fairly low continuous intensity. Increases your heart rate and breathing 1.
