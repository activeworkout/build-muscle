Positive cardiac activity means the doctor observed the baby&#39;s heart beating. A person with heart disease or cardiovascular disease may be referred to a cardiologist. First, since each electrical impulse generates one heartbeat, the number of electrical impulses determines the heart rate. To evaluate the significance of cardiac activity on endovaginal ultrasound in embryos up to 10 mm in size.
