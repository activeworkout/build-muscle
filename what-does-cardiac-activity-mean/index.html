Positive cardiac activity means the doctor observed the baby&#39;s heart beating. A person with heart disease or cardiovascular disease may be referred to a cardiologist. First, since each electrical impulse generates one heartbeat, the number of electrical impulses determines the heart rate. To evaluate the significance of cardiac activity on endovaginal ultrasound in embryos up to 10 mm in size.

<p>The variation in the cardiac cycle results in an increase or decrease in the cardiac output. The act of a human eating, sleeping or even thinking is considered a physiological activity. The presence or absence of discernible cardiac activity was recorded. Cardio means “heart” and vascular means “vessels that circulate fluids.” keeping this in mind, cardio exercise typically refers to activities that cause a sustained increase in your heart rate and breathing and consequently, an increase in the circulation of blood and oxygen throughout the body to the muscles you’re working.</p>
