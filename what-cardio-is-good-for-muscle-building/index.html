Top cardio for muscle building From pt.slideshare.net
Bodybuilders need healthy hearts to pump oxygen blood through your muscles and organs. So, suppose you were to do a weight training session along with a bodybuilding cardio workout. If you are part of this group, often referred to as hardgainers, keep your cardio at minimum for eight to 12 weeks, getting your training and diet dialed in until you have put on 15 to 20 pounds of mass. From data like this, it would seem logical to stop cardio altogether to maximize muscle growth.
