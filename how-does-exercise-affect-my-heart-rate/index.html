Your heart begins to beat quicker to deliver oxygenated blood to them. The second heart may exhaust, whereas the healthy heart becomes stronger with a lower resting heart rate. When you perform cardiovascular exercises, the entire blood flow becomes directed towards the working muscles, away from the regions that aren’t working much (like your digestive tract or arms). As we make more blood vessels, there are more places for blood to flow, which results in more efficient circulation.

<p>So, say you start off being able to run 10km in 45mins with an average heart rate of 150 beats per minute (bpm), after a period of regular training you might be able to run the same distance in the same time with an average heart rate of 140bpm.

<p>The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit of time). Cardiovascular exercise increases the number of new blood vessels while resistance training increases the size of those blood vessels. More oxygen is also going to the muscles.

<p>This means the heart beats fewer. Strenuous exercise, such as weightlifting, can cause this temporary increase in heart rate that exceeds the maximum rate. The american heart association, for example, says your target heart rate during moderate intensity activities should be about 50% to 70% of your maximum heart rate, while during vigorous physical activity you should aim for roughly 70% to 85% of your max.
