<p>There are actually three types of cardiolipin. Lesser levels of igg and igm phospholipid (cardiolipin) antibodies and antibodies of the iga isotype may occur in patients with clinical signs of aps but the results are not considered diagnostic. The anti cardiolipin igm antibody test enables you to diagnose inappropriate blood clot, analyze the cause for regular miscarriages, and analyze any autoimmune diseases. The test requires a blood sample that is usually taken from a vein in the arm.</p>
