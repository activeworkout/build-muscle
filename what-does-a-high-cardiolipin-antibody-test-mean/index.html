Antibodies attack cardiolipins by mistake. An antibody is a substance in your blood that helps fight infection. The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps).

<p>A negative result means only that the cardiolipin antibody class tested (igg, igm, and/or iga) is not present at this time. Platelets, blood cells that help blood to clot, also get used up, leading to problems with bleeding. The test for cardiolipin antibodies may also be ordered when an individual has signs and symptoms of an autoimmune disorder and/or has a positive result on an ana test, as the test may provide the health care practitioner with additional information to help establish a diagnosis.

Moderate to high levels of cardiolipin antibodies persisting when tested 12 weeks later, indicates continued presence of the antibody. There are actually three types of cardiolipin.
