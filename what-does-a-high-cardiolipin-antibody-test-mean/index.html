Antibodies attack cardiolipins by mistake. An antibody is a substance in your blood that helps fight infection. The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps).

<p>A negative result means only that the cardiolipin antibody class tested (igg, igm, and/or iga) is not present at this time. Platelets, blood cells that help blood to clot, also get used up, leading to problems with bleeding. The test for cardiolipin antibodies may also be ordered when an individual has signs and symptoms of an autoimmune disorder and/or has a positive result on an ana test, as the test may provide the health care practitioner with additional information to help establish a diagnosis.

<p>Antibodies attack cardiolipins by mistake. The anti cardiolipin igm antibody test enables you to diagnose inappropriate blood clot, analyze the cause for regular miscarriages, and analyze any autoimmune diseases.

Moderate to high levels of cardiolipin antibodies persisting when tested 12 weeks later, indicates continued presence of the antibody. There are actually three types of cardiolipin.

<p>Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them for just a short while due to an infection or drug, or present but without symptoms as a person ages. This could indicate that the patient may have cardiolipin antibody syndrome. This test is typically performed when a patient experiences unexplained blood clots, recurrent miscarriages, or autoimmune disease symptoms [ 5 ].
