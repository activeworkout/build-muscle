This is where the process of cellular respiration takes over. Cellular respiration has 4 distinct processes, which drive the creation of atp. Cell respiration usually occurs in the presence of oxygen (see aerobic respiration) but some organisms can respire without oxygen (see anaerobic respiration ). Most eukaryotic cells, including human cells, use.
