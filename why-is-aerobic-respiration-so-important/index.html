Why is cellular respiration important Knowledgeneed From knowledgeneed.com
The breakdown of chemical bonds allows the energy stored. The major role of oxygen in aerobic respiration is to synthesize the energy currency of the cell atp by accepting electrons generated from the breakdown of the macromolecules present in the food. In many creatures, oxygen is an essential component of aerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration is important because it is the primary way that your cells produce energy.
