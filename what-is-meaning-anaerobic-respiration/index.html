<p>[adjective] living, active, occurring, or existing in the absence of free oxygen. However, while aerobic respiration produces atp far more quickly and effectively than anaerobic respiration, human beings experience both. It means, it conserves only 2.12 % of the total released energy in the usable form (atp energy). Finally, aerobic respiration produces far less lactic.

<p>This series of biochemical reactions is also called a “metabolic pathway.” two types of cellular respiration exist: A type of cell respiration that takes place in anaerobes, and in which energy is released from glucose and other foods without the presence of oxygen. In higher organisms, aerobic processes take place when cells generate energy from the oxidation of organic molecules which is a process that releases large amounts. Of, relating to, or being activity in which the body incurs an oxygen debt. Respiration &amp; gas exchange.</p>
