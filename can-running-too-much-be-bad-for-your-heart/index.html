While this is sad and unfortunate, it does not make marathons a bad thing to do. Chronic extreme exercise training and competing in endurance events can lead to heart damage and rhythm disorders. The stories of long distance runners suffering sudden cardiac arrest (sca) and other heart conditions, might leave you doubting that there may be a risk attached to running. People with genetic risk factors are especially vulnerable.
