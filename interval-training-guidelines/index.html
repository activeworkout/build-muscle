Whether you’re looking to get into distance running or simply to start a new workout regimen, incorporating interval running into your training plan is an efficient way to get the most out of your time on the track or treadmill. Run at interval pace—roughly 85 to 95 percent of max speed—for one minute. You should also read the cardio training guide, which will teach you everything you need to know about cardio, including how to calculate your cardio training zones. Ideally, to see improvements in your cv fitness you should aim to do two interval sessions per week for a minimum of twenty minutes.
