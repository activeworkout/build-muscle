Some fitness trackers and apps do this for you. That means we burn more fat, 11 more grams per 500 calories, by walking for 55 minutes than by running for 42. A cardio peak training workout is a hybrid of the two; At the fat burning range, the percentage of calories your body is using from fat is higher.
