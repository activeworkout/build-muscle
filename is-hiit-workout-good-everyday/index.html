HIIT CARDIO &amp; ABS CIRCUIT !! At home workouts for all levels! From pinterest.com
Hiit is intense, and beginners are less likely to stick with super intense programs. I think variety is important. But when it comes to an intense exercise like hiit, doing it every day, or for periods longer than 30 minutes can put you at risk for injury, overtraining, mental burnout, and prevent muscle recovery. Hiit, on the other hand, takes 20 to 30 minutes, including warmups and cooling down.
