Ad converts organic material such as food. Anaerobic digestion (figure 1, route 2) is a series of processes whereby microorganisms break down biodegradable materials in the absence of oxygen to produce biogas. Anaerobic digestion happens in closed spaces where there is no air (or oxygen). This simple, yet revolutionary concept resonates perhaps even more so today than when those seven syllables were.

Anareobic digestion is the process by which bacteria breaks down organic waste matter (such as landfill methane, animal and food waste, and wastewater treatment sludge) in the absence of oxygen to. In addition, this process is environmentally friendly, as it is estimated that 0.5 to 1.0 of carbon dioxide is stored annually. The term anaerobic digestion isn’t something most people are familiar with, however, the process is actually fairly simple. How Anaerobic Digestion Works OMEX OMEX.</p>
