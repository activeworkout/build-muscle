The right coronary artery supplies blood to the right ventricle and atrium of the heart as well as sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. Symptoms like chest pain usually don’t happen until you’ve had it for a while. The primary task of the right coronary artery is to ensure proper circulation to the myocardium—the muscles of the heart—and, as such, influences the overall functioning of the body. They are called the coronary arteries because they encircle the heart in the manner of a crown.
