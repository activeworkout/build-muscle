ASE Poster 5 Guidelines for Stress Echocardiography From medmovie.com
Exercise testing is a form of cardiovascular stress testing that uses exercise with electrocardiography (ecg) and blood pressure monitoring. This guideline was developed for the evaluation of acute or stable chest pain in outpatient and emergency department settings, emphasizing the diagnosis of chest pain with an ischemic etiology. Anesthesiologists order most preoperative cardiac stress tests according to professional societal or institutional guidelines (72%), yet they are not always choosing the best modality of cardiac stress test. Cardiology stress test ordering guidelines.
