<p>Anaerobic definition, (of an organism or tissue) living in the absence of air or free oxygen. What does aerobic mean biology? Enterobacteriaceae, vibrionaceae, and pasteurellaceae are the three major families of facultative anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic means living, active, occurring, or existing in the absence of free oxygen, as opposed to aerobic which means living, active, or occurring only in the presence of oxygen. anaerobic may also refer to: Aerobic Bacterial Metabolism Definition &amp; Process Video &amp; Lesson.</p>

<p>For example, bacteria that need oxygen to grow are called aerobic bacteria. Some microorganisms are capable of anaerobic cellular respiration, which means they can survive in very harsh conditions. This builds up in muscles causing pain and tiredness.
