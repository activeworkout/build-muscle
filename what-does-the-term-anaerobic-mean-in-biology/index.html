Anaerobic means living, active, occurring, or existing in the absence of free oxygen, as opposed to aerobic which means living, active, or occurring only in the presence of oxygen. anaerobic may also refer to: Aerobic Bacterial Metabolism Definition &amp; Process Video &amp; Lesson.</p>

<p>For example, bacteria that need oxygen to grow are called aerobic bacteria. Some microorganisms are capable of anaerobic cellular respiration, which means they can survive in very harsh conditions. This builds up in muscles causing pain and tiredness. Anaerobic conditios are those in which oxigen is not present, or present in very low quantities. Difference between Aerobic and Anaerobic Respiration Bio Differences.</p>
