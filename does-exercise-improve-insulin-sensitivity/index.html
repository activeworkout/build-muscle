In general, when people with diabetes exercise, they require less insulin for good control. Others have reported that aerobic exercise training is an effective strategy to improve insulin sensitivity in caucasians with a fh+ (18, 20, 21) and exercise can improve insulin sensitivity in hispanics predisposed to type 2 diabetes and with overt type 2 diabetes.

<p>This is due both to a more rapid absorption of insulin from exercised sites and to an increase in the effectiveness of the insulin. Improving your insulin sensitivity can make your overall diabetes management easier in both the short and the long run, and exercising is one of the most effective ways of improving your insulin sensitivity. Exercise and insulin utilize different signaling pathways, both of which lead to the activation of glucose transport, which perhaps explains why humans with insulin resistance can increase muscle glucose transport in. When your muscles contract during activity, your cells are able to take up glucose and use it for energy whether insulin is available or not. Role of Exercise in Reducing Insulin Resistance.</p>
