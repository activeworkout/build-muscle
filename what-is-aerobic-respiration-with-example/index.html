Cellular Respiration THE PHYS ED EXPRESS From thephysedexpress.com
Anaerobic respiration is the type of respiration through which cells can break down sugars to generate energy in the absence of oxygen. It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from food. In aerobic respiration, the glucose is the complete break down into carbon dioxide and water by oxidation. Molecular oxygen is the most efficient electron acceptor for respiration, due to its high.
