<p>It's a biological process in which naturally occurring microorganisms break down organic waste and produce gas—mostly methane along with some. In this instance, “organic” means coming from or made of plants or animals. Anaerobic digestion is a natural biological process where organic matter is broken down by bacteria in the absence of oxygen to produce biogas for renewable energy. Anaerobic digestion happens in closed spaces where there is no air (or oxygen).</p>
