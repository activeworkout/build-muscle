However, these gas analyses systems are costly and take time to calibrate for each test. Measure your resting heart rate (hr) find your radial pulse, located between your radius bone on the thumb side of your forearm and the tendon in the middle of your wrist. Aerobic exercises can help promote heart and lung health and improve how well the body circulates. That involves carefully examining how well the body takes in and utilises oxygen.
