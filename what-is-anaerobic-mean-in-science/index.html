This is in contrast to the highly efficient process of aerobic respiration, which relies on oxygen to produce energy. Anaerobic means living, active, occurring, or existing in the absence of free oxygen, as opposed to aerobic which means living, active, or occurring only in the presence of oxygen. anaerobic may also refer to: Aerobic respiration, as the name suggests, is the process of producing the energy required by cells using oxygen.
