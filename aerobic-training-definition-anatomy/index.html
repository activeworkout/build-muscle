<p>This is in contrast with anaerobic exercise which is driven by energy sources within the muscles and not by oxygen uptake. The use of aerobic and anaerobic exercise in practical examples of differing intensities link practical examples of sporting situations to aerobic or anaerobic exercise. The american college of sports medicine recommends that healthy people exercise 3 to 5 times a week for 30 to 60 min at a rate of at least 64% of their maximum heart rate. Aerobic exercise is when the intensity of physical activity is sufficient enough to lead to a significant increase in the uptake of oxygen in muscles.</p>
