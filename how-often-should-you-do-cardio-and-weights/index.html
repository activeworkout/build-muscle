If your objective is to gain muscle then cardio 1 to 2 times/week and weight training 3 to 6 times/week you can also combine light cardio with your weight training days, but at a much lighter intensity than if you are. Doing some light cardio before lifting weights is beneficial because it loosens up your muscles and gets the blood flowing. You can safely do some type of cardio every day of the week, but if you are also weight training then you are better off alternating days instead of trying to do cardio and weight training on the same day.
