During aerobic exercise, you breathe faster and deeper than when your heart rate is at rest. When combined with healthy, balanced nutrition, it has several health benefits such as losing weight, building, maintaining muscle, and enhancing your cardiovascular endurance. Sprint interval training, or sit, is a form of high intensity interval training (hiit) that involves running as fast as you can. Increased muscle strength and muscle mass helps protect your joints, which can protect you from injury.
