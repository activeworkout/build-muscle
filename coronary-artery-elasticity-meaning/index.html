Cardiovascular System histology From histology.medicine.umich.edu
The underlying mechanism of coronary ectasia is not well. Anomalous rca is a rare entity with an incidence of 0.29%.1 it usually originates from the left main coronary artery with an incidence of 0.009%. Arteries carrying oxygenated blood from the heart into the body can become stiff and lose elasticity with age, and the issue can be exacerbated when the vessels have plaque buildup. The coronary arteries wrap around the outside of the heart.
