Increasing cardiorespiratory endurance means that you will increase your physical shape, and therefore be able to exercise for longer periods and at a higher intensity level. Cardiorespiratory endurance is characterized by all the following except: A condition caused by training too much or too intensely characterized by lack of energy, decreased physical performance and aching muscles joints. Consists of the heart, blood vessels, and respiratory system.
