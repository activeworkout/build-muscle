The target heart range zone that is most appropriate for you depends on your fitness goals and the goal of the specific cardio workout. Depending of the length of exercise and rest periods, it may be anaerobic or aerobic training. As noted above, the cardiovascular fitness hypothesis suggests that cardiovascular (i.e., “aerobic”) fitness is the physiological mediator that explains the relationship between physical exercise and improved cognitive performance. The ability of the heart and blood vessels to supply nutrients and oxygen to tissues (including muscles) during sustained exercise.
