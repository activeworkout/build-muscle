Sure, you could try working out at home while you’re quarantined, but as any experienced fitness enthusiast will tell you, home workouts just aren’t that effective as your regular training sessions at the gym or with your local running group. If you were running a mile and a half a day, start by just running a few blocks. And you can always restart your plan even if you haven’t exercised for months or years.
