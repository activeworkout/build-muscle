The anaerobic capacity is the amount of energy that is obtained from anaerobic energy systems. Anaerobic work capacity (also called awc or w’) can best be seen as an energy tank that represents the size of your anaerobic energy system. The purpose of this study was to determine the validity of w&#39; as anaerobic. Anaerobic capacity is at the pointy tip of the spear for many athletes.

<p>Normally anaerobic system works from the second of start of exercise till 2 minutes. If you are using wko5, this is called functional reserve capacity, and this anaerobic capacity calculation is expressed in kilojoules. Anaerobic work capacity is a measure of how much anaerobic work (without oxygen) your body is able to put in at any given time during the ride. Your anaerobic capacity is the amount of work you can perform at an intensity above lactate threshold power output. Scientifically Explaining My 3000m Run. Critical Power, Anaerobic Work.</p>
