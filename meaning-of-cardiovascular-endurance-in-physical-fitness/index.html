Cardiovascular endurance is the ability of heart to deliver blood, oxygen and nutrients present in it to the working muscles for a prolonged period. Aerobic exercise is more useful for gaining cardiovascular endurance because it helps sustain more output for a longer period. A study from the karolinska university hospital and linköping university tested the mitochondrial activity in participants performing either endurance or resistance. Endurance is defined as the capacity to accomplish an activity for an extended amount of time (usually a long duration of time).

<p>Cardiovascular endurance is the ability of heart to deliver blood, oxygen and nutrients present in it to the working muscles for a prolonged period. Cardiorespiratory fitness (from now on just fitness) is defined as the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen during sustained physical activity.fitness is not only an objective measure of habitual physical activity, but also a useful. In other words, it can be said that it is the physical ability to maintain aerobic exercise for prolonged period of time. There is no need to worry about running a marathon to reap the benefits of cardiovascular health, however.</p>
