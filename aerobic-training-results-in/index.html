It includes aerobic training, often referred to as cardiovascular or cardio for short; “training at a level of intensity at which an athlete can maintain an adequate supply of oxygen to the body’s musculature to fuel necessary contractions.”. Aerobic training should be done at least 3 times a week, at an intensity between 70% and 80% of their maximum heart rate, and normally goes for 30&#43;min in duration.
