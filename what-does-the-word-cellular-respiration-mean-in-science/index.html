It should not be confused with the respiratory system. Cellular respiration is a process at the cellular level that produces this atp energy; Cellular respiration is a critical function by which cells release energy for various cellular activities like locomotion, biosynthesis, and even the transportation of molecules between membranes. It should not be confused with the respiratory system.
