This study examines whether heart rate recovery (hrr) improves as a result of exercise training during cardiac rehabilitation (cr). During the aerobic exercise, the participants wore a polar heart rate analyzer (polar electro oy, finland) to monitor exercise intensity and keep it within the target heart rate range. Here is an overview to guide you through heart rate monitoring: Finally, use the ymca standards (see table below.

During the aerobic exercise, the participants wore a polar heart rate analyzer (polar electro oy, finland) to monitor exercise intensity and keep it within the target heart rate range. Heart rate recovery (hrr) after strenuous exercise has been shown to be faster (i.e., heart rate decreases more quickly) among individuals with higher levels of fitness and after aerobic training programs in a variety of adult and pediatric populations (13,24,30,33).thought to represent both the restoration of parasympathetic input and the withdrawal of sympathetic.
