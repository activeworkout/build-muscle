This study examines whether heart rate recovery (hrr) improves as a result of exercise training during cardiac rehabilitation (cr). During the aerobic exercise, the participants wore a polar heart rate analyzer (polar electro oy, finland) to monitor exercise intensity and keep it within the target heart rate range. Here is an overview to guide you through heart rate monitoring: Finally, use the ymca standards (see table below.
