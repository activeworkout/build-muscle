The muscles are tested with anterior (palmar) abduction of the thumb in the frontal plane for the longus and in the sagittal plane for the brevis. Always start the examination of upper extremity strength by testing for drift: The maximum force that can be generated depends on the size and number of muscles involved, the proportion of muscle fibers called into action, the coordination of the muscle groups, the physical condition of the muscles and the mechanical. Increased muscle strength can only be achieved by working.
