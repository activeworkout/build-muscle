The cardiolipin antibodies blood test is a test to detect the presence of cardiolipin antibodies in blood. A cardiolipin antibodies test looks for a certain kind of antibody in your blood. Tests for igg and igm cardiolipin antibodies are frequently requested to help find the cause of an unexplained thrombotic episode, recurrent miscarriage, or thrombocytopenia.they may be requested with lupus anticoagulant testing to help investigate the cause of a prolonged ptt (activated partial thromboplastin time), especially if clinical findings. Phospholipid (cardiolipin) antibodies must be detected on 2 or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart to fulfill the laboratory diagnostic criteria for aps.
