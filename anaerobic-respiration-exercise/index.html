Examples of anaerobic respiration sore muscles and lactic acid. Anaerobic exercise is any activity that breaks down glucose for energy without using oxygen. In fact, anaerobic means absence of oxygen. this can be contrasted with aerobic exercise that consumes oxygen at a sustainable pace such that an activity can be continued for a long duration of time. Anaerobic exercise is any activity that breaks down glucose for energy without using oxygen.
