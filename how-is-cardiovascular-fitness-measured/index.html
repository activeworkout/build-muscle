How Is Cardiorespiratory Endurance Measured? From livestrong.com
Cardiovascular fitness is expressed as your vo2 max — the maximum volume of oxygen you can take in through your lungs, pump around your body using your heart and blood vessels and then make use of in your muscles. In the gym or the lab, your cardiovascular fitness will be measured by calculating your vo2 max. Changes in heart rate and blood pressure, derived from this volume measurement, were used to distinguish truthful from deceptive answers of a culprit. As noted above, the cardiovascular fitness hypothesis suggests that cardiovascular (i.e., “aerobic”) fitness is the physiological mediator that explains the relationship between physical exercise and improved cognitive performance.
