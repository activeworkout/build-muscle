Risk factors for small vessel disease include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, too much fat in the blood, lack of exercise and some dietary factors like too much salt.
Small‐Vessel Disease in the Heart and Brain Current Knowledge, Unmet From ahajournals.org
Small vessel disease occurs when there’s damage to the inside of the walls of the tiny blood vessels that connect to your larger coronary arteries. Small vessel disease results in arterial wall changes. Coronary heart disease (chd), also called coronary artery disease, involves plaque formation that can. These abnormalities can include evidence of prior strokes, which are often small and.
