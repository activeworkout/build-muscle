<p>When you are exercising, your muscles need extra oxygen—some three times as much as resting muscles. Lay down for one minute, take your heart rate and write down the number of beats per minute. During exercise, the heart must beat faster to eliminate excess carbon dioxide and increase the supply of oxygen in the body. This will be recorded in a table in b. Lab report heart beat.</p>

Previous lessons may have already looked at observing the effects of exercise on the body, but this experiment asks students to find out what effect exercise has on the heart rate.

Thats likely because exercise strengthens the heart muscle. This activity was designed for anatomy and physiology students who are studying how feedback loops work and also serves as a refresher on the scientific method and designing experiments (science and engineering practices).
